## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

### First timer on Git? Read this.
1. Download a source control software for easy life, such as GitKraken or SourceTree. Or just go wild I dunno whatever
2. Sign in to Github on that thing
3. Clone this repo to that thing
4. Profit

Too complicated? Read the other stuff below maybe something else works for you


### Edit project using Github

1. Clone repo
2. Branch out from Development and give the branch descriptive name (f.e. your own name or task name) 
3. Do your stuff and push them to your branch
4. When done with a feature, merge into Development or ask owner to merge the branch.
5. Merge Development back to own branch & repeat steps from 3 for new stuff.

### Edit project *without* Github

1. Go to Development branch on Github website.
2. Download project as zip
3. Do the work
4. Put changes into a Unity package and send to a contributor or owner **OR**
4. Give project files with all changes to a contributor or owner and inform them which commit the new changes were made on. (Means the last commit before downloading the project, it will help merging)

### Other ways
- You can give new content to one of the contributors who will add them to the project.
- You can create own project and edit everything there, then create a Unitypackage of the new shit.
